## Step-by-Step Setup

### Clone the Warehouse Simulation (Docker Environment)
Clone the pre-built warehouse Docker setup:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CollaborativeRoboticsLab/industrial-robots-and-systems-world.git
cd industrial-robots-and-systems-world

```
### Run the Simulation Container

Before starting the containers, allow Docker to access your display for GUI apps (so RViz and the warehouse simulator can open):

```bash
xhost +local:root
